# Doing analyses for Miranda Chiong's REU project
# Steps have been largely copied from this doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBrNMVzRvO8HOBFZUrbWhPAdppvrLDYoRz0gSt-2cVg/edit

# Workflow: 
# 1. Determine what series/data we plan on using
#  - Crossdated (has rho value)
#  - Cut off for what is not an acceptable correlation value: p<0.05; 
#  - if multiple cores, use highest correlating
#  - Has pith (use LWCA spreadsheet)
# 2. Identify/Compute response variable
#  - **Opt A:** Raw Ring Width (have easy; no additonal calcs needed) **USING THIS ONE TO START**
#  - Opt B: Basal Area Increment (better metric of 2-dimenisional growht, but would have to calculate; likely more worthwhile if looking at more years)
#  - 2.1. re-align to be based off of age
#  - 2.2. calculate the mean for the establishment window: starting with 10 years for now (could try other windows)
# 3. Graph Establishment Conditions
#  - Plan A: Originally wanted to compare trees with known establishment vs. unknown, but we don't have good enough data
#  - **Plan B** [what we're going with]: Describing establishment Conditions
#  - 3.1. Describing the variability in year of establishment --> are they from the same year or are there groups before/after certain events like the Arb's founding or when the region was settled?
#.     -- CR Note: This is the piece that will really be of most interest to folks at the Arboretum
#  - 3.2. Describe the variability in growth rates during establishment --> is it a pretty tight/normal distribution or super variable?
#  -- [[Added from CR: can look at the *trend* in initial growth and see if it's declining (sign of geometric decline; typical of open grown) or increasing or stead]]
